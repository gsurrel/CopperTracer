"""Built from the "Complex plugin example" from the KiCad documentation:
docs.kicad-pcb.org/doxygen/md_Documentation_development_pcbnew-plugins.html#ppi_complex_exam

> As described in PEP 338 Python can execute packages (or modules) as scripts. This can be useful to implement a command-line stand-alone version of your KiCad plugin with minimum effort. In order to implement this feature, a `__main__.py` file is created in the package directory. This file can be executed by running the following command.

```
python -m CopperTracer
```
